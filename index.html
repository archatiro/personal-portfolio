            <img src="bruh.png" alt="">

            <img src="hmetwnfootball.png" alt="">
            <p>In this project, I worked to replicate the <a href="https://www.memphis901fc.com/" target ="_blank">Memphis 901 FC website's</a> features and structure in a test of my HTML and CSS skills. This project was the first project I truly felt proud of.</p>

            <p>This project enticed my creativity, as now I was able to carry out my own ideas into creating a fitness-themed landing page. This project also included a contact form powered by <a target="_blank" href="airform.io">airform.io</a></p>

            <h2>Rock paper scissors</h2>
            <img src="rockpaperscissors.png" alt="">
            <p>Through this project based off the classic, I used the Big Three of Front-End Web Development: HTML, CSS, and javascript. The majority of the rigor in this project was centered around the logic of the rock paper scissors game--when would the enemy go? How would you be able to translate a button click through the DOM into a value that the computer could compare to another value(that being the enemy's choice) and make a descision? All of these problems had to be overcome in order to arrive at complettion.</p>
